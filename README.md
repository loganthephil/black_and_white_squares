# CISC/CMPE 204 Modelling Project: Black and White Squares

Our project concerns are black and white squares that must be separated such that no two of the same colour are in the same “section” as denoted by the drawn line and checks if a given solution to the puzzle is "solved".

## Running With Docker

To run our project with docker, type in the command:
`python run.py` or `python3 run.py`

## Structure

* `documents`: Contains folders for both of your draft and final submissions. README.md files are included in both.
* `run.py`: General wrapper script that you can choose to use or not. Only requirement is that you implement the one function inside of there for the auto-checks.
* `test.py`: Run this file to confirm that your submission has everything required. This essentially just means it will check for the right files and sufficient theory size.
